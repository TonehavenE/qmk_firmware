Everything has remained functional thus far; we are nearing the end. However, the QWERTY key(column 3, row 10, I believe) is constantly being actuated.
I am going to enable debugging again to see if it is a firmware or matrix issue. I did reflow that joint recently.

CONSOLE_ENABLE = yes
COMMAND_ENABLE = no

Hmm. these changes produced a corrupt HEX. I don't know why.

Instead, this version is the removal of all TAP_DANCE Related firmware.

TRIUMPH! IT'S COMPLETE AND COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL!
